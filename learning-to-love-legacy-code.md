I'm spending most of my time fixing legacy Perl and PHP applications these days. I've done quite a bit with legacy applications before, but here working with large numbers of them, I've fine tuned my approach to understanding them and I kinda wanted to share it. 

# Context matters
Legacy code is a product of its time and of the countless layers of patches applied to it.

# Superstitions != truth
# Visit their homes
# Don't jump to conclusions
