Generally speaking, it's hard to get into IT, but once you're in and manage to hold down a job for a year or so (and put that fact where recruiters can find it), suddenly recruiters start paying attention. Even if you aren't looking, contacts from recruiters will quickly become part of your dally life. It's frankly a little overwhelming at first, but it's also a really valuable thing, if you learn to cope with it. 

I wanted to share some titbits of information that I've learnt from dealing from recruiters throughout my career so so far. For context, I'm based in North-West UK and I'm more on the DevOps side of IT at the moment though moving in the direction of development.
